Let them know that your success is also their success!\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>Be specific in your requests of people – use the assertive techniques that we’ve discussed\r\n                            in assertive communication. Give some thought as to what you really need and ask for it.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>Find ways to celebrate with friends and family that don’t involve alcohol. If a friend or\r\n                            family member is having a birthday or an anniversary, ask the person organizing the party to\r\n                            provide alternatives alcoholic drinks - like pop, tonic water, fruit juice or tea. Practice\r\n                            saying <a href=\"/problem-drinking/session?pageId=11&sessionId=39\" target=\"_blank\">\"No thanks\"</a> in a polite way before you attend the\r\n                            function and remember: there’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed about when you tell people\r\n                            that you’re making smart lifestyle changes. You may even inspire some others to make the\r\n                            same smart choice.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>Involve your family when creating your <a href=\"/problem-drinking/session?pageId=15&sessionId=39\" target=\"_blank\">coping plan</a>.

Remember that it’s also important to address areas of concern. For example, make sure\r\n                            that everyone knows that you won’t be offended when they do not to ask you to go out to a\r\n                            bar after work on Friday.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>Explain to your partner, roommate or family that one of your early coping strategies calls\r\n                            for the need for you to clear out the cupboards and fridge. Make sure that everyone\r\n                            understands that, for the time being, it’s important to keep the house or apartment free of\r\n                            alcohol.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                    <p>The Health Educators in our anonymous community are also a great resource. Stop by our community\r\n                        or use the Instant Messenger to communicate with another member. By reading about and sharing\r\n                        experiences, you’ll see how others are not only struggling with some of the exact same issues\r\n                        that you are, but they’re also succeeding - just like you!</p>\r\n                    <h4 class=\"eh_subtitle h4_subtitle\">Setbacks</h4>\r\n                    <p>Be prepared for setbacks and prepare your support squad for them. Help them to understand how\r\n                        you’ll handle <a data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#slip\">slips</a>.</p>\r\n                    <p>Setbacks do happen. There’ll be periods when you may feel compelled to go back to your past\r\n                        drinking patterns. When this happens, reach out to your Support Networks ASAP. Your Support\r\n                        Network is there to help you - so use them when you need them the most.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        When setbacks are about to occur, or when they do occur, these are the times when you should\r\n                        find your way to the Instant Messenger, Support Group or Health Educators so you can get some\r\n                        help. There’s bound to be someone going through the exact same thing you’re going through. After\r\n                        sharing, you’ll feel much better and you’ll be ready to start fresh with a new perspective.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Or how about this: after you begin to succeed with this program, how about finding a new member\r\n                        that you can help out? New members will certainly be ready to learn from your experience,\r\n                        success and new-found wisdom. We bet that helping someone else out will make you feel good\r\n                        too.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n                ', 'text', 40, NULL, 0),
